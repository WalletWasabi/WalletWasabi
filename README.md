**Important Note:** Until the stable version is out, one should not use it on the mainnet, but only on the testnet for testing purposes. Please give me a lot of work by opening GitHub issues or send me an email to `adam.ficsor73@gmail.com`.
  
## Status & Roadmap
1. [Full Block Downloading SPV](https://medium.com/@nopara73/bitcoin-privacy-landscape-in-2017-zero-to-hero-guidelines-and-research-a10d30f1e034) - **Ready, unstable.**  This feature provides full node level privacy against network analysis with SPV security.  
2. [ZeroLink compliance](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/) - **Next up.** ZeroLink is a Bitcoin Fungibility Framework, it includes Wallet Privacy requirements and a mixing technique: Chaumian CoinJoin.   
3. [Transaction Filtered Block Downloading](https://medium.com/@nopara73/full-node-level-privacy-even-for-mobile-wallets-transaction-filtered-full-block-downloading-wallet-16ef1847c21)  - 10-100x performance increase, while still keeping full node level privacy against network analysis, but replacing SPV security to trusted full node security.  
4. Release stable version.  
5. TumbleBit Paymen Hub Mode? JoinMarket integration? Stealth addresses support?

## Building From Source Code  
  
### Requirements:  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
- [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Tor: On Linux and OSX make sure "tor" is in your PATH!
  
### Step By Step
  
1. `git clone https://github.com/nopara73/HiddenWallet.git`
2. `cd HiddenWallet/HiddenWallet.Daemon`  
3. `dotnet restore`  
4. `dotnet publish -r win-x64 --output bin/dist/current-target`. Depending on your platform replace `win-x64` with `win-x86`, `linux-x64` or `osx-x64`.  
5. (Only on Windows) - Copy and unzip `HiddenWallet.Packager/tor.zip` to `HiddenWallet.Daemon/bin/dist/current-target` directory. (Quick note on unzipping: the final path to tor.exe has to be: `current-target/tor/Tor/tor.exe` and not: `current-target/tor/tor/Tor/tor.exe`.)
6. `cd ../HiddenWallet.Gui`
7. `npm install`
8. `npm install -g typescript`
9. `tsc`
10. `npm start`
11. Check out the [Configuration section](https://github.com/nopara73/HiddenWallet#configuration) above.

### Running The Tests

1. Download [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/download), (for Windows you need the Expert Bundle) and use this configuration file: [torrc](https://github.com/nopara73/DotNetTor/blob/master/torrc)  
2. Run Tor 
3. `cd HiddenWallet.Tests`  
4. `dotnet restore`  
5. `dotnet build`  
6. `dotnet test`  

*Notes:* 
- Some tests have been prefunded with testnet coins. If some funny dev messing with the wallets (sending transactions to them, spending them and such) those tests might fail, too.

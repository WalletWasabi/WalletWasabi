## Code review (CR)

- Read the description of the Pull Request. If it is missing ask for it if necessary.
- Check Continuous Integration (CI) before code review. Only continue if it is passed.
- Do not review code longer than 60 minutes or more than 400 lines. Take a 10 minute pause at that point.
- Check for code smells. Give constructive feedback that helps (Not hurts).
  - Easy to read.
  - Maintainable.
- Checkout PR and test it if required.
- Request changes if needed.
- Approve if you are done.

__Tips__: if the PR is too big ask for breakdown.

__Fact__: code review is one of the few scientifically proven code improvement tools.

## Creating Pull Request

- Fill the title.
- Fill the description.
  - If it fixes issues [add keyword](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords).
  - Add related issues and PR links.
  - Add Sub-Tasks with checkboxes.
- If the PR is not ready or Work in progress (WIP) create a Draft Pull Request - so nobody will spend time to review a temporary code, but can see the progress there.
- Implement feature.
- Always fix CI.
- Set Reviewers.
- If it is UX related always ask Jumar or Dan to review.

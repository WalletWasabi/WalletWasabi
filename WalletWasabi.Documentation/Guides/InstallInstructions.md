After opening Wasabi, you may encounter a security popup. You can bypass it in multiple ways. One way would be to keep the control key down while opening Wasabi.

# GPG Verification

[Get GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html), then save [nopara73's PGP](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/PGP.txt).

Import the key you downloaded to GnuPG. Open the terminal/command line:

```sh
gpg --import PGP.txt
```

With this public key, from now on, you will be able to make sure the Wasabi software you download was not tampered by checking against the corresponding `.asc` file:

```sh
gpg --verify {path to downloaded signature}.asc {path to binary}
```

Example: `gpg --verify WasabiInstaller.msi.asc WasabiInstaller.msi`.
 
If the message returned says Good signature and that it was signed by `Ficsór Ádám` with a Primary key fingerprint: `21D7 CA45 565D BCCE BE45  115D B4B7 2266 C47E 075E`, then the software wasn't tampered with since the developer signed it.
 
Remember to check again the PGP signature every time you make a new download.

If you trust nopara73's key and you are familiar with the [Web Of Trust](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/147447/gpg-why-is-my-trusted-key-not-certified-with-a-trusted-signature), please consider also [validating it](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html).

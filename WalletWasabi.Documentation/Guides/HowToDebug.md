# Developers' Guide for debugging Wasabi

This guide is for giving detailed instructions about how to debug Wasabi Wallet components to those developers who want to contribute to the project.
We will focus on how to achieve this with `vscode` first because that is the cross-platform IDE used by some of the developer team members.

## Before Starting
We assume the reader has already read the project [README](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/README.md) file and has installed the [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), and knows how to clone the repository and build the Wasabi solution.


## Install VS Code and C# extension
### 1: Get Visual Studio Code
Install Visual Studio Code (VSC).
Pick the latest VSC version from here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


### 2: Install C# Extension
Open the command palette in VS Code (press <kbd>F1</kbd>) and type `ext install C#` to trigger the installation of the extension.
VS Code will show a message that the extension has been installed and it will restart.
Installing this extension can take a while.


### 3: Open the WalletWasabi directory in VS Code
Go to `File->Open Folder` and open the WalletWasabi directory in Visual Studio Code.
The Wasabi vscode settings forces a download of the latest omnisharp versions every time the folder is opened and this can take a while.

After this step we are ready to start configuring the build tasks and the launches.

## Understanding the Wasabi components

Wasabi Wallet is a client/server system where the client part is the Wasabi Wallet that users download and install on their machines, and the server part is the Wasabi backend that runs on the zkSNACKs servers.
Additionally, the solution contains other components like the Packager used to prepare the Wasabi client to be distributed, integration tests, project, and others.

Here we are going to focus first on how to debug the client component, and then the backend component.

### Wasabi Client

Let us start by creating the launcher (it goes into the `.vscode/launch.json` file).
This file contains the list of projects that can be launched, how to do it, what tasks have to be executed before the launching, etc.

```json
{
   "version": "0.2.0",
   "configurations": [{
      "name": "Wasabi GUI .NET Core",
      "type": "coreclr",
      "request": "launch",
      "preLaunchTask": "build-client",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Fluent.Desktop/bin/Debug/net6.0/WalletWasabi.Fluent.Desktop.dll",
      "args": [],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Fluent.Desktop",
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart",
      "sourceFileMap": {
          ".": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
   }]
}
```


It is important to see that this launcher requires the execution of a `build-client` task.
That is defined in the tasks file (it goes into `.vscode/tasks.json` file).

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [{
        "label": "build-client",
        "command": "dotnet",
        "type": "process",
        "args": [
           "build",
           "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Fluent.Desktop/WalletWasabi.Fluent.Desktop.csproj"
        ],
        "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
    }]
}
```

After these two files are created press (CTRL+SHIFT+D) to go to the debugger, set a couple of breakpoints, select the `Wasabi GUI .NET Core` launcher (it should be the only one available) and press the play button.
That is all.

### Wasabi Backend

In the same way we did with the client part, we need to create a launcher and a task for running and debugging the server-side component.
Let us start with the launcher.
Add the following launcher to the array of `configurations` in the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

```json
{
   "name": "Wasabi Backend .NET Core",
   "type": "coreclr",
   "request": "launch",
   "preLaunchTask": "build-backend",
   "program": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Backend/bin/Debug/net6.0/WalletWasabi.Backend.dll",
   "args": [],
   "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Backend",
   "stopAtEntry": false,
   "internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart",
   "launchBrowser": {
       "enabled": true,
       "args": "${auto-detect-url}",
       "windows": {
           "command": "cmd.exe",
           "args": "/C start ${auto-detect-url}"
       },
       "osx": {
           "command": "open"
       },
       "linux": {
           "command": "xdg-open"
       }
   },
   "env": {
       "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
   },
   "sourceFileMap": {
       "/Views": "${workspaceFolder}/Views",
        ".": "${workspaceFolder}"
   }
}
```
As before, we need to create a task for compiling the backend project before executing the code, and this is done again in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file.
Add the following task to the array of tasks:

```json
{
   "label": "build-backend",
   "command": "dotnet",
   "type": "process",
   "args": [
      "build",
      "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Backend/WalletWasabi.Backend.csproj"
   ],
   "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
}
```

And that is all.
Once this has been done a developer can press (CTRL+SHIFT+D) to go to the debugger, set a couple of breakpoints, select the `Wasabi Backend .NET Core` launcher and press the play button to start debugging.

    ]
}
```

## Debugging code with unit tests

Because `dotnet test` will run the test code in a child process, it isn't possible to configure a "unit test debugging" configuration in `launch.json`.
You can tweak debugging options for unit tests by addind the followin setting to your local `.vscode/settings.json` file (if it doesn't exists then create it):

```json
   "csharp.unitTestDebuggingOptions": {
        "sourceFileMap": {
            "WalletWasabi/": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi",
            "WalletWasabi.Fluent.Desktop/": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Fluent.Desktop",
            "WalletWasabi.Tests/": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Tests",
            "WalletWasabi.Backend/": "${workspaceFolder}/WalletWasabi.Backend"
        }
    },
```

## How to setup and run the whole system

Sometimes, as developers, we need to test an advanced interaction between the Bitcoin Core node, the Coordinator, and one or more Wasabi clients.
Just imagine a case in which we want to verify the system behavior after a blockchain reorg.
In these cases we have to setup and run all the components, and use regtest.

### Install Bitcoin Core

Download and install Bitcoin Core from [https://bitcoincore.org/bin/](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/).


### Running the backend (coordinator)

There is more than one way to do this:

* From **VSCode** go to the Debug panel (CTRL+SHIFT+D), select `Wasabi Backend .NET Core` and press play.
* From **Terminal** just type `dotnet run <WasabiProjectFolder>/WalletWasabi.Backend/WalletWasabi.Backend.csproj`

### Get some coins to test

Once the Wasabi backend, the bitcoin node and the Wasabi client are running, we can mine some blocks and get the new mined coins into our Wasabi wallet.

1. Go to Wasabi and generate a new address
2. Open a terminal and type `bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 101 <your-wasabi-address>`

After this we should receive our first 50 bitcoins!

> Reproducible [or deterministic] builds are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code.- https://reproducible-builds.org/

This guide describes how to reproduce Wasabi's builds. If you got stuck with these instructions, take a look at how to build Wasabi from source code: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi#build-from-source-code

# 1: Assert Correct Environment

In order to reproduce Wasabi's builds you need Git, Windows 10 and the version of .NET Core SDK that was the most recent in the time of building the release.

# 2. Reproduce Builds

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi.git
git checkout {hash of the release} // This works from 1.1.3 release, https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases
cd WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi.Packager/
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run -- --onlybinaries
```

This will build our binaries for Windows, OSX and Linux from source code and open them in a file explorer for you.

# 3. Verify Builds

You can compare our binaries with the downloads we have on the website: https://wasabiwallet.io/
In order to end-to-end verify all the downloaded packages you need a Windows, a Linux, and an OSX machine.

## Windows

After you installed Wasabi from the `.msi`, it will be in `C:\Program Files\WasabiWallet` folder. You can compare it with your build:

```sh
git diff --no-index win7-x64 "C:\Program Files\WasabiWallet"
```

## Linux && OSX

You can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux to verify all the packages in one go. At the time of writing this guide we provide a `.tar.gz` and a `.deb` package for Linux and .dmg for OSX.  
Install the `.deb` package and extract the `tar.gz` and `.dmg` packages, then compare them with your build.

After installing WSL, just type `wsl` in explorer where your downloaded and built packages are located.

### .deb

```sh
sudo dpkg -i Wasabi-1.1.6.deb
git diff --no-index linux-x64/ /usr/local/bin/wasabiwallet/
```

### .tar.gz

```sh
tar -pxzf WasabiLinux-1.1.6.tar.gz
git diff --no-index linux-x64/ WasabiLinux-1.1.6
```

### .dmg

You will need to install `7z` (or something else) to extract the `.dmg`: `sudo apt install p7zip-full`

```sh
7z x Wasabi-1.1.6.dmg -oWasabiOsx
git diff --no-index osx-x64/ WasabiOsx/Wasabi\ Wallet.App/Contents/MacOS/
```

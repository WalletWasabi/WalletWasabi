# Testing

The goal of this document is to establish a manual testing workflow and checklist for Wasabi Wallet in order to make sure larger pull requests and releases don't accidentally ruin vital functionality.

# Environment

Someone must go through this document before every release on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) and macOS 10.14 (Mojave).

## Setup

See this quick tutorial for getting the latest release and for updating:

https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi#build-from-source-code

#### Run Wasabi in Release Mode

Run Wasabi with `dotnet run -c Release` from the `WalletWasabi.Gui` folder.

### How to checkout a pull request?

Check the id of the pull requesest.
```sh
git fetch origin pull/ID/head:yourbranchname
git checkout yourbranchname
```

#### Updating a pull request

If someone made a change to the pull request and you want to go through the tests again, first checkout the master branch `git checkout master` then continue with the same procedure described in the "How to checkout a pull request?" part. It will update your branch.

### DataFolder location?

Open Wasabi and go to Main Menu / File / Open / Data Folder.

### How to check error?

Standart procedure: look at the terminal. If there is something ERROR or WARNING that is probably an error.
Special case: always defined at the specific test case.

### How to determine if the application is exited?

Look at the terminal. Wait until log messages stop and you will get back your blinking cursor. If nothing happens appearingly try to press enter. If the application hanged you can also check it in process manager. If it is still running there might be an endless loop which is an error and don't let the application to close.

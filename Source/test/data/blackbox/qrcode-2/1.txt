When we at WRT talk about \"text,\" we are generally talking about a particular kind of readable information encoding - and readable is a complex proposition. Text may be stylized in a way we are unfamiliar with, as in blackletter - it may be interspersed with some markup we don\'t understand, such as HTML - it may be be a substitution system we aren\'t familiar with, such as braille or morse code - or it may be a system that, while technically human-readable, isn\'t particularly optimized for reading by humans, as with barcodes (although barcodes can be read).

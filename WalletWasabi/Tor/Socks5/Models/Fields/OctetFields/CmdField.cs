		// a remote lookup of the hostname provided as the target address in the SOCKS

		// resolved) or a success response.In the case of success, the address is

		// an IPv4 address as its target, Tor attempts to find the canonical
		// hostname for that IPv4 record, and returns it in the "server bound

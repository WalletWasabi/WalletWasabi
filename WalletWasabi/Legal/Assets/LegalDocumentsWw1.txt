SUMMARY
=========================================

    The WASABI team is committed to be fully transparent to its users, from its source code to the legal aspects of its services. The purpose of Wasabi Wallet is to provide privacy for its users’ Bitcoin transactions. This means that with the use of the wallet we would like to enable the users to make Bitcoin payments in such a way that their spending history, wallet balances, etc. are not visible to the receiving party. This does not necessarily mean that the user stays anonymous, since the receiving party might have to identify the sending party.
    Our goal is to minimize the unintentional leaking or disclosure of private financial information to third parties and to the receiver of any transaction resulting from the use of the Wasabi Wallet. The protection of your privacy and the protection of your (personal) data is our highest priority, which also defines the essence of our services.
    One instance of the Wasabi Wallet CoinJoin coordinating server is operated by a legal entity, zkSNACKs Ltd. Thus, in order to legally provide our services to our clients, we have defined the framework and the rules that both parties must follow in order to protect each other.

    The most important parts of the document below is summarized in the following points:
     - The service is open-source under the MIT license.
     - The service is provided on a non-custodial basis. Safekeeping of keys are the sole responsibility of the user.
     - The user is solely responsible to act according to their local laws and regulations.
     - We do not store any personally identifiable information. Moreover, our trustless software architecture prevents us from gathering this information in the first place.
     - A transaction fee is only charged by the service provider for CoinJoin transactions.
     - We only provide written support, and NEVER ask for recovery words, passwords or similar security critical information.

    The services are provided between remote parties and therefore these terms and conditions cannot be individually negotiated with clients. This document will help each of our clients to understand exactly the terms and conditions under which we can provide our services. We recommend you to first learn the basics of Bitcoin before starting to use our services.

    PLEASE READ THE BELOW TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING AGREE, OR BY ACCESSING OR DOWNLOADING OUR SOFTWARE (AS DEFINED BELOW), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

=========================================
I. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
=========================================

    If you are accepting these terms on behalf of an entity, you confirm that you are authorized on behalf of that entity to agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and all terms incorporated by reference.

1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
=====================

1.1 SCOPE
    This binding Agreement is between
     - zkSNACKs Ltd. (“Service Provider” or “we”, which includes our subsidiaries, partners, affiliates, agents, employees, licensors, service providers or subcontractors (if any)) and
     - the person, persons, or entity (“You” or “Your”) using the Services (as defined below).

    These Terms apply to the download of the Client Application (as defined below), any access and use of the Client Application , our website at https://wasabiwallet.io or its onion mirror at http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion (*) and our CoinJoin Coordinator Services (as defined below), and any of our other Services related to or utilizing any of the foregoing, which we refer to in these Terms and Conditions documents (“Terms” or “Terms of Use”), collectively, as our “Services”.

1.2 ELIGIBILITY AND AGREEMENT
    If You use the Services these Terms apply. You will be solely liable for any damage or consequences arising from use without the full acceptance of the rules. The Service Provider shall not be liable under any circumstances in this case.
    You can use our Services only if You can lawfully enter into an agreement pursuant to these Terms under applicable law. You acknowledge that Your use of this Software is at Your own discretion and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
    Due to the nature of the Service, we cannot guarantee the full compliance of user transactions, therefore it is Your own responsibility to ensure that the use of Wasabi Wallet complies with Your local laws and jurisdiction.

1.3 RESPONSIBILITY FOR WALLET BACKUPS AND OTHER AUTHENTICATION MEANS
    With our Services You, and only You are able to access and transact through Your wallet. This is enabled by Your recovery words, passwords and encrypted secret keys. If you use our Services to create a wallet, the software will use an algorithm to generate random recovery words and optionally combines it with an additional word (called the passphrase as defined in BIP39), where Wasabi may use your chosen wallet password as the default passphrase. We call the combination of the recovery words and the passphrase as wallet backup, or backup.

    THE SERVICE PROVIDER EXPRESSLY DECLARES THAT IT DOES NOT STORE, HAVE ACCESS TO, OR HAVE ANY WAY OR MEANS OF RECOVERING YOUR BACKUP.

    It is Your responsibility to keep your wallet backups, your wallet files, and your passwords secure. You should not provide this information to anyone, including any Service Provider representative. Encrypted private key information is stored locally on Your computer in a wallet file. Private keys can be accessed with the password, which You created at the generation of the wallet.
    If You permanently forget or lose Your backup, You will NEVER be able to recover any bitcoin in Your wallet, and You will suffer a complete, irrecoverable loss of all bitcoin in Your wallet. In the event of such loss, we shall not be liable for any lack of access to the wallet and we shall not be obliged to make wallet access, or the keys required for that purpose available.
    The Service Provider has no responsibility and will not be liable for any loss or damage You suffer from the loss or misappropriation of Your backup.
    From the point of downloading we do not store or manage any data, we have no knowledge or information about either the installation, or the use of the wallet.

1.4 OUR PRIVACY POLICY
    Our Privacy Policy is located at Chapter II. Our Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into these Terms and should be read carefully as it contains important information about handling personal data.

1.5 CHANGES TO THESE TERMS
    We may make changes to these Terms, including when there are changes to our Services, technology or any law or regulation to which we are subject and/or for any other reason. If we do, we will post the updated Terms on our website and change the “Last Updated” date above. Any amended Terms will become effective no earlier than 14 days after they are posted and will apply prospectively to the use of our Services after such changes become effective, except that any changes addressing new functions of our Services or changes made for legal reasons will come into effect immediately. Your continued use of our Services following the effective date of such changes will constitute Your acceptance of such changes. If You do not agree to any amended Terms, You must discontinue using our Services, otherwise the liability rules set out in Section 1.2 will apply.

2 THE COINJOIN COORDINATOR SERVICES
===================================

2.1 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
    This Software consists of the Client Application and the CoinJoin Coordinator (both as defined below) and functions as a free, open-source, non-custodial desktop Bitcoin wallet. The Software does not constitute an account where we or other third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of Your bitcoins. The Software and our Services are therefore not a bank, a custodian, an exchange, a financial intermediary or a regulated financial institution and is exempt from the authority of the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission or any other financial institutions.

    The client application (“Client Application”) is software, with the sole purpose of allowing You access to the Bitcoin network and our Services (as defined below), without the need or requirement to create or maintain a user account. The application itself is an ordinary Bitcoin desktop wallet with ordinary features. Wasabi Wallet does not store, send or receive bitcoins. This is because bitcoins exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Bitcoin network. Any transfer of title in bitcoins occurs within the decentralized Bitcoin network, and not in the Wasabi Wallet.
    The CoinJoin Coordinator Service is an online service that implements trustless CoinJoin to prevent third parties from spying on the Blockchain. Throughout the process, the Service does not initiate or process any standalone transactions whatsoever towards third parties (i.e. non-users of the Service) and therefore does not store or transmit value belonging to others. For further information on how it works please visit our GitHub page: https://github.com/zkSNACKs

2.2 FEES
    Subject to the other provisions of these Terms, including, but not limited to Section 3 on Prohibited Activities, You may freely download and use the Client Application without any charge or fee imposed on You by the Service Provider.
    The Service Provider does not charge You transaction fees for normal Bitcoin transactions, however You are still subject to transaction fees, charged by the Bitcoin network.
    Both the Service Provider and the Bitcoin network charge You transaction fees for CoinJoin Bitcoin transactions.

    The transaction fee, charged by the Service Provider is 0.003% multiplied by the number of users in each round of transaction You initiate, except if:
     - You are providing the unspent transaction outputs with the smallest accumulated value to the round. In this case You are not being charged with any fees by the Service Provider.
     - You are providing unspent transaction outputs, in a way that the final CoinJoin transaction would result in a change output back to You that is smaller than or equal to 1% of the denomination of the CoinJoin round. In this rare case, a change output will not be generated, to gain an edge on privacy. Instead, the value of the change output will be added to the fees charged by the Service Provider after the round.

    BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 1.1 YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT OUR COORDINATOR AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCTS THE TRANSACTION FEES FROM THE TRANSACTION YOU SUBMITTED FOR THE SERVICES IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPHS.

    The Service Provider reserves the right to charge additional fees or to change the amount of fees, and we will provide You at least 30 days advance notice of any such change. The Service Provider reserves the right to waive and/or reduce any fee at any time, with or without notice.

	/// Issues anonymous credentials using the coordinator's secret key.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// CredentialIssuer is the coordinator's component used to issue anonymous credentials
	/// requested by a WabiSabi client. This means this component abstracts receives
	/// <see cref="CredentialsRequest">RegistrationRequests</see>, validates the requested
	/// amounts are in the valid range, serial numbers are not duplicated nor reused,
	/// and finally issues the credentials using the coordinator's secret key (and also
	/// proving to the WabiSabi client that the credentials were issued with the right
	/// key).
	///
	/// Note that this is a stateful component because it needs to keep track of the
	/// presented credentials' serial numbers in order to prevent credential
	/// reuse. The API is concurrency safe. Additionally it keeps also track of
	/// the <see cref="Balance">balance</see> in order to make sure it never
	/// issues credentials for more money than the total presented amount. All
	/// this means that the same instance has to be used for a given round (the
	/// coordinator needs to maintain only one instance of this class per round)
	///
	/// About replay requests: a replay request is a <see cref="CredentialsRequest">request</see>
	/// that has already been seen before. These kind of requests can be the result of misbehaving
	/// clients or simply clients using a retry communication mechanism.
	/// Reply requests are not handled by this component and they have to be handled by a different
	/// component. A good solution is to use a caching feature where the request fingerprint is
	/// used as a key, in this way using a standard solution it is possible to respond with the exact
	/// same valid credentials to the client without performance penalties.

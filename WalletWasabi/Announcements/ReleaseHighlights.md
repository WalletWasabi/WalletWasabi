## Release Summary
Wasabi Wallet v2.4.0 brings send to Silent Payments addresses!

### 🤫 Send to Silent Payments addresses

Silent Payments are privately reusable static addresses. While sending Bitcoin to them is as easy as sending to regular addresses, it is not possible for an observer to link several payments to the same Silent Payments address.

They are useful to send an address to multiple persons at the same time (tips, donations...) or to make multiple payments between the same entities (salary, rent...).

Wasabi is now one of the first wallet to support send to Silent Payment addresses, and we hope that more wallets will join! We are working on allowing receiving, please bear with us!

### 🎁 Start of our Donation Campaign

Wasabi is Free Open Source Software (FOSS).
No service is provided, and therefore it doesn't generate any revenue.

However, maintaining and improving the software requires ongoing effort, such as maintenance, continuous improvement, bug fixes, testing, documentation, regular updates etc...

While Wasabi is one of the best tools available to use Bitcoin privately, achieving flawless financial-sovereign privacy is still a work in progress.
There are many features yet to be implemented, and your support can help make them a reality.

Additionally, contributors cover static costs, such as server expenses and release management, using their personal funds.

A donate button has been added on the main screen.<br/>
It uses Silent Payments, so it's a great way to test that new feature!

By donating, you’re directly supporting the developers who work tirelessly to maintain and improve Wasabi Wallet and make Bitcoin privacy accessible for everyone.

### 📝 Release Notes in the client

If you've reached this far, you've probably noticed that the release notes highlights are now available in the client! They are displayed every first launch after an update.

Full release notes are still available on GitHub.

## Release Summary
Wasabi Wallet v2.4.0 brings send to Silent Payment addresses!

### 🤫 Send to Silent Payment addresses

Silent Payments are privately reusable static addresses. While sending Bitcoin to them is as easy as sending to regular addresses, it is not possible for an observer to link several payments to the same Silent Payments address.

They are useful to send an address to multiple persons at the same time (tips, donations...) or to make multiple payments between the same entities (salary, rent...).

Wasabi is now one of the first wallet to support send to Silent Payment addresses, and we hope that more wallets will join! We are working on allowing receiving, please bear with us!

### 🎁 Donation Button

Wasabi is Free Open Source Software (FOSS).
No service is provided, and therefore it doesn't generate any revenue.

However, maintaining and improving the software requires ongoing effort, such as maintenance, continuous improvement, bug fixes, testing, documentation, regular updates etc...

While Wasabi is one of the best tools available to use Bitcoin privately, achieving flawless financial-sovereign privacy is still a work in progress.
There are many features yet to be implemented, and your support can help make them a reality.

Additionally, contributors cover static costs, such as server expenses and release management, using their personal funds.

A donate button has been added on the main screen.<br/>
It uses Silent Payments, so it's a great way to test that new feature!

By donating, you’re directly supporting the developers who work tirelessly to maintain and improve Wasabi Wallet and make Bitcoin privacy accessible for everyone.

#### 🧪 ~~TestNet 3~~ -> TestNet 4

Instead of TestNet 3, Wasabi now uses TestNet 4.

This new network has slightly different mechanisms that mitigates some of the problems that were undermining TestNet 3 to the point that it is basically unusable.

While using the test network will be much more enjoyable now, coins from TestNet 3 don't exist on this new network. You must use a faucet and get yourself TestNet 4 coins.

### 📝 Release Notes in the client

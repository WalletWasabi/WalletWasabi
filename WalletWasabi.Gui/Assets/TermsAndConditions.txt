2 THE PRIVACY ORIENTED BITCOIN TRANSACTION SERVICES
===================================================

2.1 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

We strongly advise to only use our services if you are familiar with cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. We recommend to first learn the basics of Bitcoin and Bitcoin transactions before starting to use our Services.
This Software consists of the Client Application and the Privacy Engine (both as defined below) and functions as a free, open source non-custodial desktop wallet. The Software does not constitute an account where We or other third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of Your bitcoin(s). The Software and our services are therefore exempt from the authority of the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission or any other financial institutions.
While the Software has undergone beta testing and continues to be improved by feedback from the open-source user and developer community, We cannot guarantee there will not be bugs in the Software. You acknowledge that Your use of this Software is at Your own discretion and in compliance with all applicable laws. You are responsible for safekeeping Your passwords, private key pairs, PINs, Recovery Words, and any other codes You use to access the Software.
We expressly declare that we do not store any private keys. Encrypted private key information is stored locally on your computer in a wallet file and/or backed up with Recovery Words, shown at the creation of the wallet. Private keys can be accessed with a password, you have given at the creation of the wallet. It is solely your responsibility to backup and to safekeep your private keys. In case of loss of private keys, you may permanently lose access to your public addresses, since we are not able to recover the private keys for You.
If You do not understand the above paragraph please learn more about Bitcoin transactions before using our Services.
The download and use of the Wasabi Wallet software is subject to the acceptance of our terms and conditions. From the point of downloading we do not store or manage any data, we do not even have knowledge about neither the installation, nor the use of the wallet.
The client application (“Client Application”) is a free and open source application, the sole purpose of which is to grant You access to the Bitcoin Network and our Services (as defined below) without the need or requirement to create or maintain a user account. The application itself is an ordinary Bitcoin desktop wallet with the ordinary features.
The Privacy Oriented Bitcoin Transaction Services is an online service that implements Chaumian CoinJoin to prevent third parties to spy on the Blockchain, and ZeroLink, an end-to-end wallet privacy framework to make sure no privacy leaks happen by any other means. Throughout the process the Service does not initiate or process any standalone transactions whatsoever towards third parties (i.e. non-users of the Service) and therefore does not store or transmit value belonging to others. For further information on how it works please visit our GitHub page: https://github.com/zkSNACKs.
It is your own responsibility to ensure that the use of Wasabi Wallet complies with your local laws and jurisdictions.

2.2 FEES

Subject to the other provisions of these Terms, including, but not limited to Section 4 on Prohibited Activities, you may freely download and use the Client Application without any charge or fee imposed on you by the Service Provider.
The Service Provider does not charge You transaction fees after normal Bitcoin transactions, however You are still subject to transaction fees, charged by the Bitcoin network and received by the Bitcoin miners.
Both the Service Provider and the Bitcoin network charge you transaction fees after CoinJoin Bitcoin transactions. CoinJoin transactions are shared transactions with other users of the wallet. You initiate a CoinJoin transaction by providing unspent transaction outputs to the Service Engine and a CoinJoin round will be executed when a sufficient number of other users provided unspent transaction outputs. The transaction fee, charged by the Service Provider is 0.003% multiplied by the number of users in each round of transaction you initiate, except if:
You are providing the unspent transaction outputs with the smallest accumulated value to the round. In this case You are not being charged with any fees by the Service Provider.
You provided unspent transaction outputs, in a way that in the final CoinJoin transaction would result in a change output back to you that is smaller than or equal to 1% of the denomination of the CoinJoin round. In this rare case, change output will not be generated, to gain an edge on privacy, rather the value of the change output will be added to the fees charged by the Service Provider after the round.
The transaction fees, both charged by the Bitcoin network and the Service Provider shall be automatically processed by our Engine by means of deducting the appropriate amount from the transaction you submit.
YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT OUR ENGINE AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCTS THE TRANSACTION FEES FROM THE TRANSACTION YOU SUBMITTED FOR THE SERVICES IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPHS.
The Service Provider reserves the right to charge additional fees or to change the amount of fees, and we will provide you at least 30 days advance notice of any such change. The Service Provider reserves the right to waive and/or reduce any fee at any time, with or without notice.

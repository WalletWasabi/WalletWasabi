# Filters Migration

Starting with Wasabi v2.2.0.0, the backend now utilizes SQLite to store and retrieve compact filters. As a result, operators need to migrate their old plain text filters to the new SQLite format.

## Migration Guide

### Using Nix

If you're deploying with `Nix`, migrating is straightforward. Simply run the following command on your backend server:

```bash
$ nix run github:WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi#migrateFilters

Database already exists. Skipping creation.
.....................................
Completed. Total processed: 371888, Total inserted: 371888
Max Block Height in DB: 853711
```
The migration tool will automatically process your filters and insert them into the new SQLite database.
The old filters will still be there untouched. We recommend to keep them for a while just in case a rollback
to a previous version is needed.


## Using dotnet

For those using dotnet, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository
* Navigate to the migration directory:
  ```
  $ cd <your wasabi repo dir>/Contrib/Migration
  ```
* Run the migration script:
  ```
  dotnet fsi migrateBackendFilters.fsx
  ```
